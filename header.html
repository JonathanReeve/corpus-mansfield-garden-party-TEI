<p>This edition is derived from <a href="https://github.com/GITenberg/The-Garden-Party-and-Other-Stories_1429">the GITenberg edition of <em>The Garden Party and Other Stories</em></a>. The text was marked up using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) format of the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI). This format, the standard markup language for archival literary projects, is a semantic markup language—unlike markup languages like HTML 4.0, which describe how a text should <em>look</em>, i.e. <code>&lt;i&gt;The Garden Party&lt;/i&gt;</code>, TEI XML describes what the text <em>is</em>, i.e. <code>&lt;title&gt;The Garden Party&lt;/title&gt;</code>. This allows text segments to be selected based on their literary attributes rather than their formatting.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/corpus-mansfield-garden-party-TEI/blob/master/header.md">The TEI text</a> is transformed to HTML using <code>xsltproc</code> and <a href="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/corpus-mansfield-garden-party-TEI/blob/master/header.md">an XSL stylesheet</a>, and combined with this introductory text, which is transformed from markdown into HTML using <code>pandoc</code>. The files are combined using <code>sed</code>, and the compilation process automated using <a href="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/corpus-mansfield-garden-party-TEI/blob/master/Makefile">a Makefile</a> written for <code>GNU make</code>. <a href="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/corpus-mansfield-garden-party-TEI/blob/master/header.md">A short jQuery script</a> handles the interactive tag behavior.</p>
<p>Since the text has been broken into segments, pilcrow marks (¶) have been used to denote the beginnings of paragraphs as they appeared in the original text.</p>
