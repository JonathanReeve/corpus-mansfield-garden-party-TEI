	abstract = {Katherine Mansfield's "The Garden Party" exposes the economic disparities within the white colonial community of New Zealand in the early twentieth century. While the wealthy Sheridan family enjoys a garden that produces "literally hundreds" of roses on "green bushes bowed down as though they had been visited by archangels," the gardens within the working class neighborhood adjacent to the Sheridan house contain "nothing but cabbage stalks, sick hens and tomato cans. Laura Sheridan, the protagonist of "The Garden Party," crosses the "the broad road" separating the classes in order to deliver a basket of party leftovers to the family of a deceased workman, a carter named Scott. In "The Garden Party," aestheticism plays a role not only in the way Mansfield describes the mood and setting or in the way Mansfield uses flowers symbolically, but aestheticism becomes part of a conflict within the protagonist herself. The story concerns the intersection of class politics and aestheticism.},

	abstract = {In spite of the general tribute to the artistic achievement of “The Garden Party,” the question of its structural unity has been one of the recurring themes in Mansfield criticism. The present article approaches this question by means of an analysis of two important elements of the story's narrative composition: time and space. The analysis suggests that the story's unity is of a dialectic nature. On a temporal level, it falls into two major phases, the time before and after the party, while the party itself is virtually insignificant. Whereas the first phase, which relates the preparations for the party, shows a hectically accelerated time-pace, resembling the time-lapse camera in film; the second phase, which relates Laura's encounter with death, shows a deceleration of the narrative pace, resembling the slow-motion camera. With these two phases, two different kinds of movements in space are correlated. The activities in the Sheridans' house convey an impression of chaotic disconnectedness, of a confusing simultaneity of different aims and directions, while the story gains a clear aim and direction in space in the second phase with Laura's visit to the dead workman's house, linking the two opposing worlds in her ‘transcendent’ experience.},

	abstract = {The {TEI} schemas and guidelines have made it possible for many scholars and researchers to encode texts of any kind for (almost) all kinds of purposes, but this excellent standard is matched by an astounding diversity of publishing tools, which is particularly true when it comes to image-based digital editions. The different needs of scholars, coupled with the constant search for an effective price/result ratio and the local availability of technical skills, have led to a remarkable fragmentation: publishing solutions range from simple {HTML} pages produced using the {TEI} stylesheets (or the {TEI} Boilerplate software) to very complex frameworks based on {CMS} and {SQL} search engines. Researchers of the Digital Vercelli Book project started looking into a simple, user-friendly solution and eventually decided to build their own: {EVT} (Edition Visualization Technology) has been under development since about 2010 and has turned into a flexible tool that can be used to create a web-based digital edition starting from transcription files encoded in {TEI} {XML}. This paper describes why this tool was created, how it works, and developments planned for the future.},

	isbn = {978-0-8057-7056-8},
	abstract = {In this new edition of Katherine Mansfield, Saralyn Daly offers a timely and discerning assessment of one of the century's most gifted writers of the short story. Out of fashion with critics when the first edition was published in 1965, Mansfield has since come to be viewed as a major influence on modernist and contemporary fiction. This revived interest shows itself in various forms; a crop of critical studies, mostly from scholars in her native New Zealand; feminist interpretations of her work; and scholarly editions of her poetry, critical writing, and letters, augmented by a collection of letters between the author and her husband, editor and critic John Middleton Murry. All of these new sources, as well as Daly's close study of early drafts of Mansfield's major stories, inform this book. Mansfield, who died from tuberculosis in 1923 at age 34, wrote often of the inadequacies of personal relationships. She sometimes used her stories to express her feelings to her husband, but his letters exhibit his failure to decode her messages; Mansfield eventually stopped writing her stories "to" or about Murry. This decision, recorded in one of her notebooks, freed her to create her finest work during the last years of her life, beginning with the stories "At the Bay," "The Garden Party," and "The Doll's House" and culminating in "The Daughters of the Late Colonel" and "The Fly." Mansfield introduced most of her character types - abused children, innocent young women and isolated older women, exploited wives, and overbearing husbands - in her earliest short story collection, In a German Pensione. From the very first she wrote from what she knew; her New Zealand youth, the artistic bohemian world of London, the Continental world in which she convalesced. This choice of subject matter has led biographers to assume her fiction is a direct account of what they perceive to be an unhappy life - an impression that is false, Daly writes, and that was initiated largely by Murry, also Mansfield's literary executor. Mansfield used her memories to compose fiction, but her stories are not literal transcriptions of her experience. In theme, style, and form Mansfield persistently developed her craft. Daly describes the long, painstaking progress that would establish her leadership in short story structure. While Mansfield's stories reflect the spiritual and artistic malaise of her age, they also represent acts of protest and social criticism. Daly's study gives the reader access to a body of work that for this very dissonance remains a cornerstone of the modernist tradition in fiction.},

	abstract = {Cet essai explore jusqu'à quel point les structures linguistiques contenues dans “The Garden Party” de Katherine Mansfield constituent des marqueurs de l'identité de classe. Tant le narrateur que les personnages de la classe supérieure utilisent des modèles de discours reposant sur le démenti et la négativité. À travers l'usage répété de questions polies, les personnages établissent une hiérarchie d'attentes limitant le choix et empêchant le défi. L'affirmation et l'assertion sont rares; le démenti et la répression sont la règle. Inversement, les membres des classes inférieures embrassent l'affirmation et agissent. Ces résultats suggèrent que le silence de Laura à la conclusion du texte doit être lu comme un acte de résistance, un refus de continuer à suivre ces formalités qui ont modelé sa vie et sa conscience jusqu'à ce moment. Le texte ne prescrit pas la route qu'elle devra suivre dans l'avenir, mais il décrit clairement où elle s'est trouvée. Cette interprétation contredit la croyance largement répandue que “The Garden Party” ne forme pas une position rhétorique claire à l'égard des enjeux d'interaction entre classes qui y sont soulevés.},

	abstract = {This article reads seventeenth-century texts about the tulip for what they have to say about an expanding global market and the new forms of cultivation and cultural competency linked to that market. A recent import from Turkey, even the tulip's name identified it as a stranger: the word derives from—and in early modern orthography is sometimes identical with—the word "turban," entering European languages as a deformation of the Persian root dulband. In herbals, manuals of garden design, poems, and other texts, the cultivation of Turkish tulips in England comes to embody the problem of the cultural effects of an expanding market—its way of violating national, racial, and religious boundaries; even its denaturalization of the claims of the "native" and the "foreign" in the figure of the migrant flower that accommodates itself to a new soil and a new climate. With particular attention to Andrew {MarveWs} "The Mower Against Gardens? as well as to the herbals of John Gerard and John Parkinson, the article details how tulip cultivation came to evoke, in a compressed way, a whole nexus of issues centering on cultural identity in an increasingly global economy.},
