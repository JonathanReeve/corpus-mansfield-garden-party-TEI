This comes to an apex by <ptr target="#76">L76</ptr>, when she "echoes" Sadie's question "dreamily." However, this inversion is not to last very long, since she becomes much more authoritative, and much less dreamy, by <ptr target="#78">L78</ptr>.

			Laura's sisters Meg and Jose are introduced here, although Laura's brother Laurie won't be introduced until <ptr target="#38">L38</ptr>. Antony Alpers suggests that the names Meg, Jose, and Laurie may be an homage to characters with those names in Louisa May Alcott's novel <emph>Little Women</emph> (572). Meg and Jose are revealed to be dressed fashionably, both in traditional apparel of distant countries. Meg's "green turban" is either a literal turban, a fashionable adaptation of the middle eastern headdress (green turbans were traditionally worn by male descendants of Mohammad), or a towel or other cloth wrapped in a similar way, as Mrs. Sheridan seems to suggest in <ptr target="#78">L78</ptr>, when she tells Meg to take the "wet thing" off of her head.

				island, proud, solitary, lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in a
				kind of silent splendour. Must they be hidden by a marquee?
		</seg>
		<interp n="28">In this thought, Laura corrects the specificity of the workman, substituting "trees" for "karakas." Karaka trees are native to New Zealand--by no means a "desert" island, but an island nonetheless. Karakas bear clusters of highly poisonous yellow fruit. Like the blue sky which is "veiled" by the gold haze in <ptr target="#3">L3</ptr>, the trees are yellowed by this poisonous fruit. The perfect day, as well, will soon be interrupted with the news of the carter's death.

			the smell of lavender. How many men that she knew would have done such
			a thing?

		<interp n="31">Laura's sexual desire blends with her desire for an authenticity that she believes exists across class lines.

Similarly, does the question "have you done that" refer to the theft of the envelope, or to the writing of the sandwich ingredients on the flag?

			As soon as Jose has begun to understand ("true," she admits) Laura's point from <ptr target="#113">L113</ptr>, that they "can't possibly have a garden-party with a man dead just outside the front gate," she dismisses it, seemingly on the basis of the dead man's poverty. Jose thinks derisively about the "little mean" cottages and, by extension, the people in them. That their gardens have only "sick hens" recalls <ptr target="#101">L101</ptr>, where cook is seen to "cluck" "like an agitated hen." Their color scheme--"chocolate brown" stands in contrast to the white theme of the party.
