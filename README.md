#An Experiment in Non-Linear Literary Criticism 
#Literary Criticism

To state the obvious, literary criticism typically takes the form of a story, centered around a central theme or argument.

#Textual Notes

This edition is derived from [the GITenberg edition of _The Garden Party and Other Stories_]. The text was marked up using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) format of the [Text Encoding Initiative] (TEI). This format, the standard markup language for archival literary projects, is a semantic markup language---unlike markup languages like HTML 4.0, which describe how a text should *look*, i.e. `<i>The Garden Party</i>`, TEI XML describes what the text *is*, i.e. `<title>The Garden Party</title>`. This allows text segments to be selected based on their literary attributes rather than their formatting. 

[The TEI text] is transformed to HTML using `xsltproc` and [an XSL stylesheet], and combined with this introductory text, which is transformed from markdown into HTML using `pandoc`. The files are combined using `sed`, and the compilation process automated using [a Makefile] written for `GNU make`. [A short jQuery script] handles the interactive tag behavior. 

Since the text has been broken into segments, pilcrow marks (Â¶) have been used to denote the beginnings of paragraphs as they appeared in the original text. 

This edition has been made using exclusively free and open-source software. This textual commentary and the source code for this project is released under the GNU Public License v3, the full text of which is available in [the included license].
