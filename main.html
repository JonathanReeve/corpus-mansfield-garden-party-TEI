				In a carnivalesque inversion of social status, Mrs. Sheridan releases her authority for the duration of the party. This comes to an apex by <a href="#76">L76</a>, when she "echoes" Sadie's question "dreamily." However, this inversion is not to last very long, since she becomes much more authoritative, and much less dreamy, by <a href="#78">L78</a>.

			Laura's sisters Meg and Jose are introduced here, although Laura's brother Laurie won't be introduced until <a href="#38">L38</a>. Antony Alpers suggests that the names Meg, Jose, and Laurie may be an homage to characters with those names in Louisa May Alcott's novel <span class="emph">Little Women</span> (572). Meg and Jose are revealed to be dressed fashionably, both in traditional apparel of distant countries. Meg's "green turban" is either a literal turban, a fashionable adaptation of the middle eastern headdress (green turbans were traditionally worn by male descendants of Mohammad), or a towel or other cloth wrapped in a similar way, as Mrs. Sheridan seems to suggest in <a href="#78">L78</a>, when she tells Meg to take the "wet thing" off of her head.

		<td class="interp">In this thought, Laura corrects the specificity of the workman, substituting "trees" for "karakas." Karaka trees are native to New Zealand--by no means a "desert" island, but an island nonetheless. Karakas bear clusters of highly poisonous yellow fruit. Like the blue sky which is "veiled" by the gold haze in <a href="#3">L3</a>, the trees are yellowed by this poisonous fruit. The perfect day, as well, will soon be interrupted with the news of the carter's death.
